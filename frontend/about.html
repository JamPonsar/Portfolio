      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I recently earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Stony Brook University this December.
        Through my academic and personal projects, I’ve gained practical experience in developing full-stack applications using technologies like ReactJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Material UI, and more.
        Alongside actively applying to new potential job opportunities and completing Leetcode questions, I am working on personal projects to enhance my skills while exploring and applying new technologies.
        These projects are designed to address real-world challenges, allowing me to gain hands-on experience and create practical, impactful solutions. <br><br>

        This past summer, I had the opportunity to work as a BMS Programmer and QA Developer Intern at Controls NYC.
        I gained invaluable insight into the building management systems industry.
        This experience not only deepened my understanding of the industry but also allowed me to apply my Computer Science skills in real-world scenarios.
        I was able to work on designing and testing software solutions, which helped me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.
        This role reinforced my problem-solving abilities and enhanced my technical expertise in areas such as software development, system integration, and quality assurance.<br><br>
        
        Beyond my technical pursuits, I’ve held leadership roles, most notably as President of the Volleyball Club at Stony Brook University, where I led a team of 10 Executive Board members and oversaw a club of over 100 active members.
        I ensured deadlines were met, coordinated weekly 8-hour practice sessions to foster team cohesion, and organized events that elevated member engagement and community participation.
        My efforts resulted in a 30% budget increase and contributed to the club becoming one of the largest sports organizations on campus.
        These experiences enhanced my leadership, organizational, communication, and project management skills, equipping me to effectively motivate teams and manage large-scale initiatives.<br><br>
        
        I am now actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and contribute to meaningful projects that create real-world impact.
        My passion for problem-solving drives me to approach challenges with creativity and determination, while my experience in software development equips me to deliver innovative solutions.
        I am excited to grow in the tech industry, collaborate with diverse teams, and work on initiatives that push boundaries and make a lasting difference.</p>
